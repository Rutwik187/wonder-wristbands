                services at a competitive price. Our founder, Mr. Jugalkishor
                Malu, was a visionary who founded Wonder Wristbands Prints,
                formerly known as Mangala Enterprises, in 1972. He saw the need
                for dependable and high-quality envelopes for use in radiology
                and general hospitals, and this motivated him to set the
                groundwork for our production and printing business. We added
                multicolor paper files and laminated files to our product lineup
                within a short period of time.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 lg:text-xl">
                We made an investment in the technology needed to produce PP
                files, PVC files, plastic files, or non-tearing files as the
                demand for stronger, more durable files grew. Having been in
                this industry for 48 years, Wonder Wristbands Prints is
                delighted to be India's most dependable provider of hospital
                stationary.
